# Outside-Fresno

Biking Page - HTML/CSS complete with the exception of a footer. Research on biking routes is complete and links are on page, just need to add pictures (maybe google map screenshots?). Also need to add description/location. Then JS for the mouseover and any new JS features we want to add.

Hiking page - HTML and CSS is mostly done, there are a couple of spacing issues, and we haven't decided on a footer, so that hasn't been done.

The API/JS is done, it is hard-coded as I'm not sure how to make it dynamic without using a framework. But the styling is done OTHER THAN I would like to override the bootstrap so that on smaller screens 2 card columns are displayed instead of 3.

We need to decide on JS/user input that is uniform/utilized across pages.

Events page- HTML and CSS is done for page.
Positioning adjustments will need to be made in header once design is finalized. This needs a background img to be decided. Finalize what type of navbar we will have. Page title will need to be positioned.
JS actions still need to be decided by group and then implemented. No JS has been start.
